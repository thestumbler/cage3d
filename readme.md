## Overview

I've been curious for some time about 3D printers, but never took the
plunge until the virus hit.  Back in March, a friend of mine pointed 
out that he was making minuature people, cars, and buildings for his 
HO-gauge model railroad layout using a $300 printer from China.  
I knew the time had come.  His model was the Ender 3, but I splurged and
got the Ender 5 Pro.  

Shortly after receiving my new printer, another friend told me I needed
an enclosure, advice that I kept putting off until I realized he was
right.  After doing a little research, I wasn't really impressed with
any of the off-the-shelf solutions.  Having an enclosure that was not
flammable seemed to be desirable, but many of the popular ones weren't.  

I found a [discussion on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/6cn21j/has_anyone_built_a_fire_retardant_enclosure_for)
regarding fire-resistant boards which sounded promising. But I wasn't
readily able to find any cheaply here in South Korea.  I saw some people
were using plexiglass, but that's just plastic and would burn.
Then suddenly I realized that I could use tempered glass.
But I imagined the complex 3D pieces that would join panes of glass
together at the corners forming an enclosure, I became discouraged.  
Such a scheme would also need to accomodate doors, panels, mounting 
points for accessories, and I was about to abandon the idea.

Then I had another idea - use the same type of aluminum extrusions 
that comprised the 3D printer itself as frames for a glass enclosure.
This appeared to solve all my objections of custom joinery, and it
seemed to me, an electronics engineers, as a doable solution with
low-risk of failure.  And furthermore, it appeared to be something I
could do with the resources I have at hand.

Let me explain.  South Koreans are not really into the DIY scene, and
finding supplies that would be trivial to get in the US can be
challenging, if not impossible.  In addition, I don't have a workshop
here, so extensive cutting, drilling, etc., is a non-starter.  To my
surprise, I was quickly able to find what I needed online.  There are
shops selling aluminum 2020 extrusions, which can be cut to custom
lengths.  I also found a place that would make sheets of tempered glass,
cut to custom sizes, chamfers, and radii on request (this service
primarily targeted homeowners who wanted a glass table-top, a common
thing here).
