# Simple Installation Notes

Probably incomplete....

The OpenSCAD design relies on three libraries:

* Corner brackets come from user MightyNozzle
  - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2503622
  - https://mightynozzle.com

* Flat hinge from NOPSCAD library:
  - https://github.com/nophead/NopSCADlib
  - https://hydraraptor.blogspot.com

* Technical Lettering library:
  - https://github.com/thestumbler/alpha
This was something I wrote a few years ago, before OpenSCAD had
text. I'm not sure it's useful anymore, but I was too lazy to change 
over to the built-in text functions.  This is a TODO item.


The alpha and the bracket code is attached to this repository in the
`uses` directory.  The NOPSCAD library needs to be downloaded and put in
your library path.
